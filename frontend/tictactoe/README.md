Your task is to implement a responsive tic-tac-toe game based on the mocks provided below and the tests cases. 
Here are the specs of the game:

- clicking an empty cell should add a symbol - a cross on odd and a circle on even turns;
- clicking a non-empty cell should do nothing;
- when a line of three same symbols is formed, the game is over, and the overlay with the winner should appear;
- clicking the restart button should reset the state of the board.
